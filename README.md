# Cognifyz Technologies Internship - Machine Learning Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies! ðŸš€ As a Machine Learning intern, I worked on several exciting tasks that involved applying ML techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Tasks Overview

# Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task was to build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features. This project aimed to enhance the ability to predict restaurant ratings, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and customers.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Implemented several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score to select the best performing model.

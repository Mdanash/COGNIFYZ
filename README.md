# Cognifyz Technologies Internship - Machine Learning Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies! ðŸš€ As a Machine Learning intern, I worked on several exciting tasks that involved applying ML techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Tasks Overview

# Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task was to build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features. This project aimed to enhance the ability to predict restaurant ratings, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and customers.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Implemented several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score to select the best performing model.

# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview

As part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I developed a restaurant recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences. This project utilizes content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and extract relevant features.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transformed the 'Cuisines' feature into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Computed the cosine similarity between restaurants to find the most similar ones.
- **Recommendation Function:** Created a function to get restaurant recommendations based on a given restaurant name.

# Restaurant Cuisine Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines. The model uses various features such as the restaurant's city, price range, aggregate rating, and the number of votes to predict the cuisine type. This task was completed as part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values in the dataset.
   - Encoding categorical variables such as the "City" and "Cuisines" columns.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selection of relevant features for classification, including:
     - City
     - Price range
     - Aggregate rating
     - Number of votes
   
3. **Model Development**
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
   - A Random Forest classifier was trained on the training data.
   - The model was evaluated on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

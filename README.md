# Cognifyz Technologies Internship - Machine Learning Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies! ðŸš€ As a Machine Learning intern, I worked on several exciting tasks that involved applying ML techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Tasks Overview

# Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task was to build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features. This project aimed to enhance the ability to predict restaurant ratings, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and customers.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Implemented several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score to select the best performing model.

# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview

As part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I developed a restaurant recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences. This project utilizes content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and extract relevant features.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transformed the 'Cuisines' feature into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Computed the cosine similarity between restaurants to find the most similar ones.
- **Recommendation Function:** Created a function to get restaurant recommendations based on a given restaurant name.
